* Lookup table of unique peices and rules
    * Used directly by wavefn collapse algo
    * Generated by code which knows about symmetries (simplifying wavefn algo)
* Wavefunction algorithm
    * Stores interface points as bit arrays, with each bit 
    corresponding to an index into the peices LUT. One array for each face 
    * Has a `pub fn step() -> bool` interface which returns false when finished. 
    * Internal state is exposed by another method
    * Have a weighting system; normalize the weights of each shape relative to others/add to one
        * Sample from that distribution when determining which tile to collapse into
        * Weight is divided by the cardinality of the symmetry 
            * (I.E. rot4 = 4, divide the shape's weight by four when replicating it in the weights vector)
